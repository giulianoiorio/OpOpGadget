# OpOpGadget
The aim of this module is to provide a number of tools  for the generation of initial conditions and analysis of $N$-body simulations. It can manage files in the format used by the N-body simulations for the codes FVFPS  and Gadget-2. 


**WARNING:**  OpOpGadget and its documentation are still under development. Some examples can be found in the folder 'tutorials'.
Comments and suggestions are welcome! If you are interested in using it and/or in introducing new functionalities you can send me an email (giuliano.iorio89@gmail.com).
